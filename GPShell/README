Global Platform Shell (gpshell)
snitmo@gmail.com

Version 1.0.0	8/3/2005

*** Summary

GPShell is a script interpreter which talks to a smart card.  It uses smart card communication protocols ISO-7816-4 and Open Platform (which later became Global Platform) 2.0.1.  It can establish a secure channel with a smart card, load, instantiate, delete, list applets on a smart card.  


*** Usage

UNIX:
gpshell scriptfile, or
gpshell < scriptfile

Win32:
GPShell.exe scriptfile, or
GPShell.exe < scriptfile

gpshell can take a script file from standard input, as well as from a file.  This way, an application can feed commands to gpshell without creating a script file.  


*** Scriptfile Commands

establish_context // Establish context
card_connect [Reader Name] // Connect to card in the reader

install_for_load -AID xxx -nvCodeLimit yyy // Install for Load 
load -file appletfile // Load applet
install_for_install appletfile AID // Instantiate applet
card_disconnect // Disconnect card
get_status -element e0 // list applets
release_context // Release context

*** Sample / Testing

We have tested this with OpenPlatform.dll version 1.0.0, Oberthur CosmopoliC 32K, and HelloWorld.bin (sample applet from JavaCard development kit 2.1.2).  See helloInstall.txt, helloDelete.txt, and list.txt for samples.

	GPShell.exe helloInstall.txt	// install HelloWorld.bin
	GPShell.exe helloDelete.txt	// delete HelloWorld.bin
	GPShell.exe list.txt		// list applets on a smart card

Make sure GPShell.exe and OpenPlatform.dll are in your path.
Make sure the script file (helloInstall.txt, etc.) and applet binary file HelloWorld.bin are in your current directory.

It should work with other smart cards that support JavaCard 2.1.2 and OpenPlatform 2.0.1.  You need to tweak options in the script files.  Please let us know how it works with the smart cards you have.
