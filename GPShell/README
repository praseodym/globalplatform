Global Platform Shell (gpshell)
snitmo@gmail.com

Version 1.0.0	8/3/2005

*** Summary

GPShell is a script interpreter which talks to a smart card.  It is written on top of the OpenPlatform library, which was developed by Karsten Ohme.  It uses smart card communication protocols ISO-7816-4 and Open Platform (which later became Global Platform) 2.0.1.  It can establish a secure channel with a smart card, load, instantiate, delete, list applets on a smart card.  


*** Usage

Make sure both GPShell.exe (or gpshell on UNIX) and OpenPlatform.dll (or .so) are in your PATH.  

UNIX:
gpshell scriptfile, or
gpshell < scriptfile

Win32:
GPShell.exe scriptfile, or
GPShell.exe < scriptfile

gpshell can take a script file from standard input, as well as from a file.  This way, an application can feed commands to gpshell without creating a script file.

put_sc_key -keyver 0 -newkeyver 0 -mac_key $new_MAC_key -enc_key $new_ENC_key -kek_key $new_KEK_key -cur_kek $current_KEK_key // add new key set version 2
put_sc_key -keyver 1 -newkeyver 0 -mac_key $new_MAC_key -enc_key $new_ENC_key -kek_key $new_KEK_key -cur_kek $current_KEK_key // replace key set version 1

*** Sample / Testing

We have tested this with OpenPlatform.dll version 1.0.0, Oberthur CosmopoliC 32K, and HelloWorld.bin (sample applet from JavaCard development kit 2.1.2).  See helloInstall.txt, helloDelete.txt, and list.txt for samples.

	GPShell.exe helloInstall.txt	// install HelloWorld.bin
	GPShell.exe helloDelete.txt	// delete HelloWorld.bin
	GPShell.exe list.txt		// list applets on a smart card

Make sure the script file (helloInstall.txt, etc.) and applet binary file HelloWorld.bin are in your current directory.

It should work with other smart cards that support JavaCard 2.1.2 and OpenPlatform 2.0.1.  You need to tweak options in the script files.  Please let us know how it works with the smart cards you have. 

* About put_sc_key

We have tested put_sc_key with Oberthur CosmopoliC 64K card and Cyberflex Access e-gate 32K.  

For Cyberflex example, please see:
	replacekey-cflex.txt	// Replace the default key set (key set version 1, value 404142...4f) with a new key (505152...5f)
	putdefault-cflex.txt	// Replace the new key (505152...5f) with the default key (404142...4f)

For CosmopoliC 64K, you need to add a key set first.  See putkey-cosmo.txt.  I have not tested this particular sample file because I do not want to burn my cards.  Please use it as a sample.

This would add a key set 1, and at the same time delete the initialization key set.  After the initialization key set is used, you can replace and add key sets as in Cyberflex.
