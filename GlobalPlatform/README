******************************************************

This is a library for providing access to OpenPlatform 2.0.1' and 
GlobalPlatform 2.1.1 conforming smart cards.

You need also the libraries zlib 1.2.3 (zlib1.dll) and OpenSSL 0.9.7e 
(libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll) or compatible. Best is to place them 
in the system directory (C:\Windows\System32 or /usr/(local/)lib 
usually) or application directory.

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the varibale GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set  
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by 
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be 
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is 
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will 
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually, 
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it. 
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information, 
e.g. keys!
