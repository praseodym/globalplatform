This is a PC/SC connection plugin for the GlobalPlatform Library.

------------------

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the variable GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually,
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it.
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information,
e.g. keys!

------------------

If you compile this on your own:

See the files INSTALL and INSTALL.w32 for details.
