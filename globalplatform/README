Title    : GlobalPlatform
Authors  : Karsten Ohme <k_o_@users.sourceforge.net>
License  : See file COPYING.LESSER
Requires : PC/SC Lite http://www.musclecard.com/ (for UNIXes)
           OpenSSL http://www.openssl.org/
           zlib http://www.zlib.net/
******************************************************

This is a library for providing access to OpenPlatform 2.0.1' and
GlobalPlatform 2.1.1 conforming smart cards.

You need also the libraries zlib 1.2.3 (zlib1.dll in Windows) and OpenSSL >= 0.9.8e
(libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll in Windows) or compatible.

------------------

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the variable GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually,
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it.
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information,
e.g. keys!

------------------

If you compile this on your own:

Compilation under Unix
----------------------

You must have CMake installed. http://www.cmake.org/ 
This can be obtained in standard Unix distributions over the integrated package system.

On a command line type:

cd \path\to\globalplatform
cmake .
make


Compilation under Windows
-------------------------

-- Requirements --

Tested with:

**** SDK ****
Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924

**** VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS ****
To have nmake install VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express

**** Windows Driver Kit (WDK) ****
The WDK is needed to build a Windows platform independent version without getting into conflict with different
Windows msvcrt DLL versions.

See http://kobyk.wordpress.com/2007/07/20/dynamically-linking-with-msvcrtdll-using-visual-c-2005/

**** OpenSSL ****
http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
--> Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.1c or higher
--> Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables might be necessary
  * Let it install the DLLs to the Windows system directory

**** zlib ****
http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
--> zlib pre-built DLL and sources, version 1.2.5
http://www.zlib.net/
--> to get current sources of zlib, version 1.2.8, the sources from the pre-built DLL and source will not work

  * Copy the zlibwapi.dll to C:\Windows\System32  
  * Copy zlib.h and zconf.h from the sources of zlib to
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include
  * Copy the file "zlibwapi.lib" from the lib directory to
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib
    

**** Doxygen ****
You need Doxygen for generating the documentation.
www.doxygen.org/ 
    
**** CMake ****
http://www.cmake.org/
--> CMake 2.8.10.2 or higher

**** Compile ****

  * Launch Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)
  * cd \path\to\globalplatform

  * cmake -G NMake Makefiles for a debug version
  * cmake -G NMake Makefiles -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release for a release version  
  * ## CMake looks for PC/SC, OpenSSL and zlib ##

  * nmake  
   
  * To build it downwards compatible you have to use a different set of common 
    runtime libraries contained in the Windows Driver Development Kit. You have
    to specifx with -DWINDDK_DIR the path to the DDK.  
  * Complete example:
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DWINDDK_DIR=C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    nmake     

  * Done! 

Source Packages
---------------

Execute:

make/nmake package_source

Binary Packages
---------------

Execute:

make/nmake package 

Documentation
-------------

For documentation you also must have Doxygen installed.

Execute:

cmake .
make/nmake doc

Ubuntu/Debian packages
----------------------

You must also have dput, pbuilder and debhelper installed.

Execute:

cmake .
make package_ubuntu

The script ubuntu-package.sh iterates over all Ubuntu series and creates dsc files for Debian package creation or Launchpad uploads.

---

You can also upload the automatically created sources.changes to Launchpad. You must be registered there and you must have a .dput.cf in place. Follow the instructions on https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/Uploading

Execute:

make dput

If you have used the ubuntu-package.sh script you must manually upload the source.changes files.

Execute:

dput gpsnapshots-ppa libglobalplatform6_6.1.0-0ubuntu1SNAPSHOT20120520195953+0200~precise.changes

---

You can create a Ubuntu/Debian package from a dsc file.

Execute:

dpkg-source -x libglobalplatform6_6.1.0-0ubuntu1SNAPSHOT20120520195953+0200~precise.dsc
cd libglobalplatform6-6.1.0
fakeroot debian/rules binary

CMake Issues
------------ 

You must rebuild the build system if your build tools have changed. Otherwise 
CMake uses outdated values. You have to delete manually 
the CMakeCache.txt file (and maybe also the CMakeLists directory and 
cmake_install.cmake).

If your are using Cygwin and you have installed the GNU compiler tools and the
bin directory is on the PATH environment variable CMake will favor these tools 
and the linking step will fail. So remove the Cygwin bin directory from the path.  

------------------

Testing is only supported under Linux for now. To generate the tests execute:

cmake -DTESTING=ON
make
make tests

For the unit tests a JCOP v2.2 41 card is used.
