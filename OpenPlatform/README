This is a library for providing access to Open Platform
conforming smart cards.

Installation:

Generel install instructions are in the file INSTALL.
Installation instruction for Windows are in the file Install.w32.

./configure
make
make install

If the configure file is not there you must run the script ./reconf

make doc

generates the documentation in HTML and LaTeX. You must have Doxygen
www.doxygen.org/ and Graphviz http://www.graphviz.org/ installed.
You can generate PS or PDF from the LaTeX on you own.

make install installs the package in the default prefix (/usr/local), so the resulting
library is installed as /usr/local/lib.

For compiling the library you must have pkg-config installed.
Usually pkg-config looks in the /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig directory.
There should placed a file libpcsclite.pc containing
information
about the required libraries, header files and other information.
If pkgconfig fails and your pkgconfig directory is at a
different location you have to set the environment variable
PKG_CONFIG_PATH. E.g. the Debian path for pkgconfig is /usr/lib/pkgconfig.

./configure --prefix=/usr Defines the installation target for everything to
    start with /usr instead of the default /usr/local
./configure --help gives you a help of possible options.
./configure --enable-debug enables debugging output on stdout

If you need to get debugging output run configure with --enable-debug.
You must enable the debugging by setting the environment variable
OPENPLATFORM_DEBUG=1. If at configure time vsyslog support was detected,
the debugging will be syslogged. If you explicitly set a log file with
the environment variable OPENPLATFORM_LOGFILE, this log file will be used.
If no vsyslog is available the default log file is /tmp/OpenPlatform.log.
