******************************************************

GPShell is a script interpreter which talks to a smart card.  It is written on top of the GlobalPlatform library, which was developed by Karsten Ohme.
It uses smart card communication protocols ISO-7816-4 and OpenPlatform 2.0.1 and GlobalPlatform 2.1.1.
It can establish a secure channel with a smart card, load, instantiate, delete, list applets on a smart card.

You need also the libraries GlobalPlatform 6.0.0, zlib 1.2.3 (zlib1.dll) and OpenSSL 0.97e (libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll) or
compatible and must place them in the directory where GPShell is called or better the system directory (C:\Windows\System32 or /usr/(local/)lib usually).

For MacOSX you might set

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib

so that all needed libraries are found.

------------------

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the variable GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually,
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it.
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information,
e.g. keys!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PLEASE OBEY THAT EVERY CARD GETS LOCKED AFTER A FEW (USUALLY 10) UNSUCCESSFUL MUTUAL AUTHENTICATIONS.
THE CONTENTS OF A LOCKED CARD CANNOT BE MANAGED ANYMORE (DELETED, INSTALLED)!!!
IF YOU EXPERIENCE SOME UNSUCCESSFUL MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPS FIRST EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION WITH A KNOWN WORKING PROGRAM
TO RESET THE RETRY COUNTER BEFORE YOU PROCEED WITH GPSHELL. CHECK THE PARAMETERS FOR MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION (KEYS, SECURITY PROTOCOL) AND ASK IF ANYBODY KNOWS IF THE CARD IS SUPPORTED.
