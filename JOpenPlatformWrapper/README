This is the JNI implementation of the the Java library for 
JOpenPlatform. JOpenPlatform depends on this library.

Installation:

Generel install instructions are in the file INSTALL.
Installation instruction for Windows are in the file Install.w32.

./configure JAVA_INC=... JAVA_INC_PLATFORM=...
make
make install

If the configure file is not there you must run the script ./reconf

You must specify with JAVA_INC the Java include directory.
Additional there must be specified the platform specific Java include
directory with JAVA_INC_PLATFORM.

make install installs the package in the default prefix (/usr/local), so the resulting
library is installed as /usr/local/lib.

For compiling the library you must have pkg-config installed.
Usually pkg-config looks in the /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig directory.
There should placed a file libpcsclite.pc containing
information
about the required libraries, header files and other information.
If pkgconfig fails and your pkgconfig directory is at a
different location you have to set the environment variable
PKG_CONFIG_PATH. E.g. the Debian path for pkgconfig is /usr/lib/pkgconfig.


./configure --prefix=/usr Defines the installation target for everything to
    start with /usr instead of the default /usr/local
./configure --help gives you a help of possible options.
